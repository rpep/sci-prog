# Scientific Programming

This repository is for the course under development for delivery for
the Faraday Institute in Oxford on the 29th and 30th of October 2018.

The course aims to bring students up to scratch with the basics around
the infrastructure necessary to modern software development, which are
widely used in the industry, but which are generally not taught in
degree level programmes, and which are not well known by many
academics. These include:

* Containerization - How can a team of developers, often working
  remotely from one another set up a consistent environment for
  developing their software? If you have ever been sent code by
  someone and not been able to run it, this section is for you...

* Version Control - No longer will you have 5 versions of your code in
  a folder with names like 'main-working-18-04-2017.cpp',
  'main-not-working-16-08-2018.cpp'... We'll teach how to set up a
  history of code development.

* Continuous integration and Testing - If you make a change to your
  code, how do you know that it's not broken? If you've ever come to
  use a part of your code and realised that it no longer works because
  you changed something else, this will be useful to you.

* Documentation - What makes good documentation? At a minimum, what
  should the requirements be? In this, we'll go through some examples
  and talk about and show some of the tools for documenting software.
