# Installation Instructions

Everything we will do in this two day workshop will require the use of Docker.
You must install it before attending the workshop as we will not have time to
go through installation issues. If you struggle to install it, please contact
me in plenty of time *before* the workshop - if you e-mail me the day before
it is unlikely we will be able to resolve any installation issues in time for
the workshop  and you will not be able to follow along with the material.

Please do not arrive on the morning of the workshop and try and install it 
there!

You will need administrator priveleges on whatever computer you bring to the
workshop. Please do not bring a computer where you do not have this!
